# Stage 1: Project Proposal

## 1. Data Stored in the Database

The database stores crime information in Los Angeles, sourced mainly from the Los Angeles Police Department. The data consists of crime location, time, categories, and other relevant information.

## 2. Basic Functions of the Web Application

The web application will have the following functions:

- Sign in as a User
- Search for a crime based on location, time, or crime code
- View a crime map that displays all kinds of crimes
- Report a new crime
- Suggest the safest path from a location to a destination

## 3. Creative Component

The website will provide users with the safest path from one location to another using crime data from the LAPD and maps from OpenStreetMap. The crimes will be visualized on the map, and roads and streets will be assigned weights based on crime frequency and severity. Shortest-path algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm will be used to provide safe and efficient routes for users.

## 4. Project Title

Awesome Crime Map in LA

## 5. Project Summary

The website aims to provide information about crimes and offer a platform for reporting crimes in Los Angeles. It will allow users to search for crimes based on location, time, or crime code and view a crime map displaying all kinds of crimes. The website will also offer the feature of suggesting the safest path from one location to another. The data will be sourced from the LAPD, and the maps will be from OpenStreetMap. A low-fidelity UI mockup and project work distribution will be part of the final peer evaluation metrics.

## 6. Description

The problem that the application aims to solve is to help residents and visitors of Los Angeles stay informed about crime and avoid dangerous areas. By providing a crime map and a feature for suggesting safe paths, the application provides valuable information for users to make informed decisions about their safety.

## 7. Usefulness

The "Awesome Crime Map in LA" application is highly useful in several ways. Firstly, there is a clear demand for accessible and up-to-date information on crime in Los Angeles, which this application seeks to provide. Secondly, the range of features offered by this application - such as crime search, reporting, and safe path suggestions - provide users with valuable resources and insights to help them make informed decisions about their safety.

There are many similar websites and applications out there, such as [CrimeReports](https://www.crimereports.com/), [SpotCrime](https://www.spotcrime.com/), and [CrimeMapping](https://www.crimemapping.com/map/ca/losangeles). While some similar websites and applications are available, "Awesome Crime Map in LA" stands out by offering a more comprehensive and **user-friendly experience**. Other applications may only provide limited information on the crime or lack a **visual crime map and path suggestion feature**. By offering a wide range of features and a user-friendly interface, "Awesome Crime Map in LA" aims to set itself apart and provide users with a unique and valuable resource.

## 8. Realness

The data will be sourced from the LAPD, which is provided in [Project Track 1 Dataset](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lz44h4D1w8KI7q5wNQcJ_Fvd7r7VokoFtDvMkiEkX7U/edit).

## 9. Functionality

Users can sign in to access all the functionalities of the website. They can search for crimes based on various criteria, view the crime map, and report any new crimes. The website also provides users with the safest path from a location to their destination.
