## Project Summary

Our project is "Awesome Crime Map in LA".

According to the dataset provided by LAPD, we are trying to implement a crime map, which can basically search, report and delete a crime. The main information about a crime contains the crime number, crime code, crime location, crime time, and emergency. 

One thing that makes our project unique is we will provide users of searching safe paths to their destination. We will provide users with several safe routes by taking into account the locations of the crime, the time of the crime, whether the crime has been solved, and the danger level of the crime.
